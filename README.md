##Lab 11: Closing

1. This repository was for storing my projects for Web Programming class at Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Spring 2013

2. My favorite project was Assignment 4, where we got to see the results of building a legitimate HTML5 + Javascript webapp. It was fun to add my own personal touches like sound design and game rules.

3. I am most proud of my Frogger game.

4. I have learned a ton about web applications and Javascript as well as the basics of server side applications using Node.js. It's nice to know there are good alternatives to PHP and MySQL.
