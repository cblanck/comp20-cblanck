    <h2 class="title">Security Report for Emily Eng's Scorecenter Application</h2>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The assignment 5 scorecenter application provides an api for submitting score data
       into a central database that allows for retrieval of highscores for a given game or user
       as well as for all scores in the database
       
       The scorecenter specifications, however, did not mention security, so there are several 
       security flaws that can be exploited with little effort. The overview is below.</p>
    
    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p>I had access to all of the code for Emily Eng's scorecenter node.js application
       so it was easy to find the bugs. I then exploited these bugs by using curl's post
       requests and a simple browser, Chrome in this case. I already knew of most of the
       possible bugs due to my own experience creating the scorecenter app, so that
       simplified the search as well</p>
    
    <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
    <p>The two major problems in this application are the result of two very common issues with web applications: no authentication,
    and no input sanitization.</p> 
    
    <p>The lack of authentication leads to the lack of guarantees that the data you are getting is legitimate.
    This can be seen in the score submission page, which takes data from any source and automatically puts it into storage. While it
    may have not been a part of the project specification, I believe it is still an important issue to deal with.</p>
    
    <p>The lack of input sanitization part of this problem can be seen in the score submission through the high score page. This page
       returns the 10 highest scores. However, if someone puts in a score that does not have proper numbers, then the output is confusing
       to anyone using the page. In addition, none of the fields are required, so submitting an empty required to the submission page
       leads to an entirely empty entry in the data.</p>
    
    <h1>Issues Found</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Cross site scripting
                <ol>
                    <li>Location: /submit.json, /usersearch, /</li>
                    <li>Severity: High</li>
                    <li>Description: All data submitted to submit.json is immediately added to the mongo database for later use
                        this has the result of allowing anyone to submit a post request to submit.json with Javascript nestled
                        within one of the variables like game_title. Then, upon viewing any page that displays that data from the
                        database, the script could then execute, allowing someone to send a redirect to another page or completely
                        mangle the contents of the rest of the data.</li>
                    <li>Resolution: </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>No authentication
                <ol>
                    <li>Issue: /submit.json</li>
                    <li>Location: </li>
                    <li>Severity: </li>
                    <li>Description: </li>
                    <li>Resolution: </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>No input restrictions
                <ol>
                    <li>Issue: submit.json</li>
                    <li>Location: </li>
                    <li>Severity: </li>
                    <li>Description: </li>
                    <li>Resolution: </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
