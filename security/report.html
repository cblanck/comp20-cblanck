    <h2 class="title">Security Report for Emily Eng's Scorecenter Application</h2>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The assignment 5 scorecenter application provides an API for submitting score data
       into a central database that allows for retrieval of highscores for a given game or user
       as well as for all scores in the database.</p>
       
    <p>The scorecenter specifications, however, did not mention security, so there are several 
       security flaws that can be exploited with little effort. The overview is below.</p>
    
    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p>I had access to all of the code for Emily Eng's scorecenter node.js application
       so it was easy to find the bugs. I then exploited these bugs by using curl's post
       requests and a simple browser, Chrome in this case. I already knew of most of the
       possible bugs due to my own experience creating the scorecenter app, so that
       simplified the search as well.</p>
    
    <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
    <p>The two problems in this application are the result of two very common issues with web applications: no authentication,
    and no input sanitization.</p> 
    
    <p>The lack of authentication leads to the lack of guarantees that the data you are getting is legitimate.
       This can be seen in the score submission page, which takes data from any source and automatically puts it into storage. While it
       may have not been a part of the project specification, I believe it is still an important issue to deal with.</p>
    
    <p>The lack of input sanitization part of this problem can be seen in the score submission through the high score page. This page
       returns the 10 highest scores. However, if someone puts in a score that does not have proper numbers, then the output is confusing
       to anyone using the page. In addition, none of the fields are required, so submitting an empty required to the submission page
       leads to an entirely empty entry in the data.</p>
    
    <h1>Issues Found</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>No authentication
                <ol>
                    <li>Location: /submit.json</li><br>
                    <li>Severity: Medium</li><br>
                    <li>Description: Any client with the capability to send POST requests can send whatever data they would like to 
                        the score center API for storage. This not only means that the scores can be trivially faked, it also means that
                        one could easily fill up the database with bogus POST requests, thus crippling the usage of the scorecenter application.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Resolution: Implement a method of authentication or encryption to make it so that only trusted sources of data
                        like certain HTML5 games or a known game website can send requests. This could be implemented by simply reading
                        the HTTP header to see where the request is from, matching it against a list of trusted sites. This is not ideal however,
                        as it is also easy to manipulate the headers that are sent in an HTTP request. The better option is to
                        implement authentication with public key encryption, where the data would be encrypted via the trusted sites private key, leading
                        to ciphertext that can only be decrypted with that site's public key. This method is already used for many transactions
                        and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is already built just for this sort of thing.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li><br>
            <li>No input restrictions
                <ol>
                    <li>Location: submit.json</li><br>
                    <li>Severity: Low</li><br>
                    <li>Description: The parameters that are supposed to be required for submitting a game score are not required
                        to fit any datatype that they should. For instance the score parameter is allowed to be a string rather 
                        than a number. This could easily lead to confusion from an application pulling data from this application
                        and makes sorting by the scores essentially meaningless. Additionally, this API allows for the user to say
                        when the score was created, which leads to not only a lack of authentication but also could lead to confusion
                        when sorting documents by date created.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Resolution: Firstly, the date_created should be set by the server using the <code>new Date()</code> function.
                        Secondly, there are multiple ways to force the other parameters to follow a certain format. For instance
                        to make sure that the score is a number one can use the built-in Javascript function <code>isNan()</code> on the
                        data being POSTed. Example: 
                            <pre><code>
                                var score = request.body.score;
                                if(isNaN(score)){
                                    response.send("Invalid POST request");
                                }
                            </code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>No input requirements
                <ol>
                    <li>Location: submit.json</li><br>
                    <li>Severity: Low</li><br>
                    <li>Description: There are no required fields for the score submission POST request, which means
                        I can send an empty POST request to /submit.json and an entry will be added to the database
                        where all the fields (except ID) are null. Here's an example of this issue (as well as the preceding issue):<br>
                        <img src="pic1.jpg" height="500" alt="This is a problem"/>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Resolution: This problem can be fixed by simply checking that all the fields are set before adding them to the
                        database and complaining if they are not set. This is the way I would do it:
                            <pre><code>
                            if(req.game_title == null || req.username == null || req.score == null){
                                res.send("Game title, username, and score all required");
                            }else{
                                //add to database here
                            }
                            </code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Overall, the security issues in this application are more annoying than dangerous.
       As there will not be any critical user data stored in the database, any issues
       cannot pose a serious threat. If the issues with authentication and input restrictions
       are resolved, I cannot see any other way this application can be improved.</p>
    
	<p>It is also important to note that the ability to do cross site scripting is NOT present in this application. Although there is 
       no input checking at all, this application avoids danger through the intelligent usage of content-types. Modern browsers
       will not attempt to parse the script tags on a page if the content-type is "text/json" as it is in the pages on this
       application. Putting everything in this format kind of defeats the purpose of a web application though, making it into 
       a glorified database server. The distinction to be made then is to decide whether it is more important to have
       simple security with less human readability or more complex security with a more human readable facade.</p>
