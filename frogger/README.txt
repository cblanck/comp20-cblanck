I have implemented all aspects of the assignment.
I additionally implemented:
* A timer
* Animation to dead_frog if frogger dies
* Sound
* Level Progression

Note that I have made the design decision that if you attempt to jump to an invalid position (onto land, off the map)
then your move does not go through. I believe this is less frustrating than killing the player for trying to go to a 
place that is invalid.

I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment.

I have spent ~10 hours on this assignment.
